# RDK3 BLE ROHM Heart Rate Example

Rutronik Development Kit 3 Programmable System-on-Chip CYB06447BZI-BLD53 "RDK3 BLE ROHM BH1792 Heart Rate Sensor" Code Example. 

This code example demonstrates a BLE Heart Rate Service with a BH1792 optical heart rate sensor. 

The code example was written referring to the “[CE217639 - BLE Heart Rate with PSoC 6 MCU with BLE Connectivity](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-CE217639_BLE_Heart_Rate_with_PSoC_6_BLE-Code Example-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0e6f765c039b)”

The evaluation kit [BH1792GLC-EVK-001](https://fscdn.rohm.com/en/products/databook/applinote/ic/sensor/optical_sensor_for_heart_rate_monitor/bh1792glc-evk-001_ug-e.pdf) from ROHM was used together with RDK3 for this code example development.

## **NOTICE**

**Infineon has discontinued the PSOC™ 64 Secured MCU product line. As a result, the CYB06447BZI-BLD53 MCU used in the RDK3 is not recommended for new designs. The Infineon CY8C6347BZI-BLD53 MCU may be considered a suitable alternative.**

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox® software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/) **v3.x** [built with **v3.0**]

- The [Python](https://www.python.org/) has to be installed manually on Windows OS. Make sure the Python installation is added to the path variable. Use this command to install the [cysecuretools](https://pypi.org/project/cysecuretools/) package:

```
pip install cysecuretools
```

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v11.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

## The Provisioning of the RDK3

The CYB06447BZI-BLD53 device must be provisioned with **keys** and **policies** before being programmed. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder. If the unsigned or not properly signed image will be written to the RDK3 PSoC™ 64 – the microcontroller will not boot. 

The “[Secure Policy Configurator](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Secure_Policy_Configurator_1.30_User_Guide-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8386267f0183a960762a5977)” tool is used for the provisioning of the new RDK3, please refer to the “ModusToolbox™ Secure Policy Configurator user guide”. 

The CYB06447BZI-BLD53 MCU must be powered from a 2.5V power source to be able to complete the provisioning. The RDK3 has an SMPS [Switching Mode Power Supply] which can be easily adjusted to provide 3.3V or 2.5V to the MCU by switching the slide-switch “SW1” on the bottom side of the board.

The default keys and policies also might be downloaded from here: [RDK3 RUTRONIK DEMO KEYS](https://github.com/RutronikSystemSolutions/RDK3_Documents/tree/main/RDK3%20RUTRONIK%20DEMO%20Keys)

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>



1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>



ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

| Argument          | Description                                                  | Required/optional |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `--board-id`      | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required          |
| `--app-id`        | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required          |
| `--target-dir`    | Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional          |
| `--user-app-name` | Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional          |

<br />

The following example clones the "[Hello world](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-hal-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-example-hal-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make modlibs` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

| Argument             | Description                                                  | Required/optional |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `--add-bsp-name`     | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application      | Required          |
| `--set-active-bsp`   | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required          |
| `--add-bsp-version`  | Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional          |
| `--add-bsp-location` | Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional          |

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

### Operation

The RDK3 is configured to act as a server that provides a “Heart Rate Service” with a “Heart Rate Measurement” characteristic. The server does the advertisement with the name “RDK3” and “Heart Rate Service” every 20 to 30 milliseconds indefinitely until a client is connected.  As soon as a client connects to the RDK3 HRS, it starts receiving notifications with heart rate data. The BH1792 is capable of detecting the presence of a pulse that is notified to the client device as a “Sensor Contact”.
